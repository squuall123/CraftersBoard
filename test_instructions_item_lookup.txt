UPDATED TESTING INSTRUCTIONS - Identify Missing Recipes
======================================================

Great news that more elements are being resolved! Now let's identify exactly 
which recipes are still missing and why.

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC
================================
Run this to analyze Recipe_Master data patterns:
/run loadfile("Interface\\AddOns\\CraftersBoard\\missing_recipes_diagnostic.lua")()

This will show:
- Success rates by lookup method
- Which recipe patterns are failing
- Detailed analysis of failure causes

STEP 2: REAL-TIME PROFESSION SCANNING
=====================================
1. Open your profession window (Alchemy, Blacksmithing, etc.)
2. Run the real-time test:
   /run loadfile("Interface\\AddOns\\CraftersBoard\\realtime_scan_test.lua")()

This will:
- Test each recipe in your open profession window
- Show exactly which ones fail and why
- Display the WoW API data for failed recipes
- Give detailed failure analysis

STEP 3: ENABLE DETAILED DEBUG MODE
==================================
Enable maximum debugging to see what's happening:
/script CRAFTERSBOARD_DB = {debug = true}

Then do your normal profession scan and check the chat for:
- "Method 1: Direct spell ID" messages
- "Method 2: Item ID lookup" messages  
- "Method 2.5: Spell key lookup" messages
- "Method 3: Name matching" messages
- "WARNING - No spell ID captured" messages

STEP 4: IDENTIFY SPECIFIC FAILURE PATTERNS
==========================================
Look for these patterns in the failed recipes:

PATTERN A - Missing Item Links:
- Recipe has no GetTradeSkillItemLink() result
- Usually enchantments or skill-ups
- Should work with Method 2.5 (spell key lookup)

PATTERN B - Item ID Not in Database:
- Recipe creates item but item ID not in Recipe_Master
- GetTradeSkillItemLink() works but lookup fails
- Might need database updates

PATTERN C - Name Mismatch:
- Recipe name doesn't match item name
- Classic WoW localization issues
- Might need fuzzy matching

PATTERN D - Special Recipe Types:
- Skill-up recipes (no items created)
- Quest recipes
- Special profession abilities

STEP 5: DETAILED ANALYSIS
========================
For each failed recipe, check:
1. What does GetTradeSkillRecipeLink() return?
2. What does GetTradeSkillItemLink() return?
3. Is the extracted ID in Recipe_Master database?
4. Does the recipe name match any item names?

WHAT TO REPORT:
==============
Please share:
1. Your profession type (Alchemy, Blacksmithing, etc.)
2. How many recipes total vs successful vs failed
3. Examples of failed recipe names and their details
4. Which method works best (Item ID vs Spell Key vs Name)
5. Any error messages or unusual patterns

QUICK CHECK COMMANDS:
====================
Check specific recipe by name:
/run print(CraftersBoard.ProfessionLinks.GetSpellIdFromRecipeMasterData("Recipe Name Here"))

Check specific item ID:
/run print(CraftersBoard.ProfessionLinks.GetSpellIdFromItemId(12345))

Check specific spell ID:
/run print(CraftersBoard.ProfessionLinks.GetSpellIdBySpellKey(6789))

This detailed analysis will help us identify exactly what's still missing
and implement the final fixes needed for 100% coverage!
